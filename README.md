This is a very rough syllabus/bibliography of different articles about the legal issues raised by AI.

## Negligent machines
What happens when the models break?

- [Negligence and AIâ€™s Human Users](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3350508) (Andrew Selbst, 2020). How might negligence law apply when humans use/rely on AI tools for decision making assistance? This Article argues that the use of AI will create several holes in negligence law, which mean that deserving plaintiffs will go uncompensated.
- [When AIs Outperform Doctors: Confronting the Challenges of a Tort-Induced Over-Reliance on Machine Learning](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3114347) (A. Michael Froomkin, Ian R. Kerr, Joelle Pineau, 2019). At the current rate, we should expect AI systems to outperform most doctors for a number of medical diagnostic tasks. At that point, relying on the AI system's predictions will become the standard of care. This Article investigates the consequences of such a future. 
- [Crashworthy Code](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3230829) (Bryan H. Choi, 2019): Drawing on lessons learned from the development of the crashworthiness doctrine in automotive litigation, this Article suggests a similar standard should be applied to negligence in software. In short, thought "[r]equiring all code to be perfect is impossible... expecting code to be crashworthy is reasonable."
